Yahtzee is a simple dice game. Each player rolls five six-sided dice. 
The player then places the roll in a category, such as chance, ones, 
twos, fives, pair, two pairs etc (see below). 

If the roll is compatible with the category, the player gets a 
score for the roll according to the rules (see below). 

If the roll is not compatible with the category, the player scores 
zero.

Code and tests to score a GIVEN roll in a GIVEN category has already
been written and is provided. 

Your task is to REFACTOR the code and/or tests in any way you see fit.
