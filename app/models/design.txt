A key cyber-dojo feature is the ability to review the [test]
events, diff by diff. Each [test] event causes a 'git commit'
plus a 'git tag' to execute in the animals git repo.
The [test] <-> [test] diffs are obtained via a 'git diff' command.
Thus cyber-dojo implements persistence using plain disk files and
does not use a database.

From a paas object you create a dojo object like this...

<code>
format = 'json'
dojo = paas.create_dojo(root_path,format)
</code>

A paas can have several dojo's...
For example, the live one off
  /var/www/cyberdojo
and a test one off
  /var/www/cyberdojo/test/cyberdojo

The format will always be 'json'.
The format used to be 'rb' which required eval's
but 'rb' is now only needed in tests to check backward
compatibility.

From a dojo object you list all its languages or
use [ ] to select a specific language.
From a dojo object you can list all its exercises or
use [ ] to select a specific exercise.
From a dojo object you can list all the katas (practice sessions) or
use [ ] to select a specific kata.
From a kata object you can list all the avatars or
use [ ] to select a specific avatar.

For example

<code>
...
dojo.languages.each {|language| ... }
java = dojo.language['Java-JUnit']
...
dojo.exercises.each {|exercise| ... }
diamond = dojo.exercises['Print-Diamond']
...
dojo.katas.each {|kata| ... }
kata = dojo.katas['34D6E7823E']
...
dojo.katas.each {|kata| ... }
kata = dojo.katas['34D6E7823E']
...
kata.avatars.each {|avatar| ... }
lion = kata.avatars['lion']
...
</code>

Note that, deliberately, none of the above checks that the object is 'valid',
that the underlying disk paths exists. This allows you to write code like this...

<code>
dojo.katas['34D6E7823E'].avatars['lion'].exists?
</code>
