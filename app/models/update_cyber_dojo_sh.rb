# The base docker containers were refactored to avoid volume-mounting
# as part of the docker-swarm re-architect work. The support_files
# were moved *inside* their docker containers by ADD'ing them to the
# appropriate Dockerfile. This often required a path-related change to
# the cyber-dojo.sh file. This is no problem for dojos started after
# the re-architecture but it is for test/fork/revert in a dojo
# started *before* the re-architecture.
#
# To help in this situation the new master cyber-dojo.sh is appended
# (in # comments) to the end of the existing cyber-dojo.sh file.
# There are two reasons for doing it this way rather than the old
# cyber-dojo.sh file being commented out and the new master pre-pended
# to it.
#
# 1. Suppose the users cyber-dojo.sh has some custom mods and they
#    tweak it in light of new info (eg new paths).
#    The next [test] would set these back to comments!
#
# 2. It follows the philosophy of cyber-dojo, that the user is in charge.
#    To quote Martin Richards, of BCPL fame
#      "The philosophy of BCPL is not one of the tyrant who thinks
#       he knows best and lays down the law on what is and what is
#       not allowed; rather BCPL acts more as a servant offering
#       his services to the best of his ability without complaint,
#       even when confronted with apparant nonsense."
