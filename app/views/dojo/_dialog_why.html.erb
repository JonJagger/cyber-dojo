      Several years ago I took part in a coding dojo in the Scotsman pub in Oslo<br/>
      ...<br/>
      It took a <em>loooong</em> time to start, installing compilers and whatnot.

        I wondered what the minimum setup could be for a coding dojo. 
        I realized it was <em>nothing</em>. 
        You could write your tests and code in a 
        web browser and run your tests on a server. 
        The more I thought about this, the more I liked 
        the idea of participants using something 
        that was so obviously 
        <em>not their normal development environment</em>.

        In a coding dojo you should <em>not</em> be thinking 
        about finishing the task; 
        you should be thinking about <em>improving some aspect of your skill</em>. 
        The practice should be repeated. Repetition frees up mental capacity, 
        helping you break out of a completion mindset 
        and into an improvement mindset.

        In a browser-based dojo, everyone can see 
        everyone else's code at all times. <br/>
        Only <em>one</em> computer needs

        in particular, the idea of treating all the 
        participants as a single team.
