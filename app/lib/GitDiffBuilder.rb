module GitDiff

  # Combines diff and lines to build a data structure that
  # containes a complete view of a file;
  #    the lines that were deleted
  #    the lines that were added
  #    the lines that have stayed the same.
  #
  # diff: created from GitDiffParser. The diff between
  #       two tags (run-tests) of a file.
  #
  # lines: an array containing the current content of the 
  #        diffed file.
  
  # The <em>single</em> column of line-numbers on the diff-page is 
  # correct when the was_tag minus now_tag difference is 1, which
  # is what it is the vast majority of the time).
  # However when the was_tag minus now_tag is greater than 1
  # you need two columns of line-numbers greater. For example,
  # look at the github diff view of a commit.
