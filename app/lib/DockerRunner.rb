# --rm
#   automatically remove the container created by running inner_command
#   on the base container - we are only interested in the output produced.
#   all files are saved and gitted into the /katas folder on the main
#   server and not in the container
#
# -v #{paas.path(sandbox)}:/sandbox:#{read_write}
#   volume mount the animal's sandbox to /sandbox inside the container
#   as a read-write folder. This provides isolation.
#
# -v #{paas.path(language)}:#{paas.path(language)}:#{read_only}
#  volume mount the language's folder to the same folder path+name
#  inside the container. Intermediate folders are created as necessary
#  (like mkdir -p). This provides access to supporting files which
#  were sym-linked from the animal's sandbox when the animal started.
#  Not all languages need this but it's simpler to just do it anyway.
#  Mounted as a read-only volume since these support files are shared
#  by all animals in all katas that chose that language.
#
# -w /sandbox
#  working directory when the command is run is /sandbox (as volume
#  mounted in the first -v option)
#
# #{language.image_name} /bin/bash -c \"#{inner_command}\"
#  the container to run the command inside is the one specified in
#  the language's manifest as its image_name. The command is always
#  './cyber-dojo.sh' which is run via bash.
