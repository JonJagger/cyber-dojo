Refactoring dojos
  Put tennis ones into zip / tar.gz ?
  ...
  Write script to unzip and ensure chown/chgrp www-data
  ...
  Auto unzip refactoring dojos after a prune_small/large true
  ...
  Add refactoring button on front page and its dialog has all
  refactoring URLs below

19th Feb 2014: On cyber-dojo.com ran
  > ruby prune_small.rb true 3 7
    2764 katas deleted
    5783 katas not deleted
  >df
  reports no inodes regained?
  Wrong partition!
  Fixed etc/fstab so instead of
      /mnt/katas /var/www/cyberdojo/katas
      it does
      /mnt/cyberdojo /var/www/cyberdojo
  which transfers about 7G from the 10G-fs to the 100G-fs :-)
  that is much better.
  ...
  Copied tar.gz files back from cyber-katas to cyber-dojo.com
  Now untarring them on cyber-dojo.com
    find . -name '*.tar.gz' -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 tar xf
  Getting some errors...
    gzip: stdin: not in gzip format
    tar: Child returned status 1
    tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors
  Need to find out which ids are causing failures and why.
  Moved them back to separate downloads folder.
  ...
  The xfer.rb script could take the URL as a parameter.
  Will probably want to xfer in both directions.
