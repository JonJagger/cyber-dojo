Here I'll put...
    o) picture from CoderDojo in Ireland. AS BACKGROUND?



    o) [donate] . Use button, not paypal image
    o) what money is used for
    o) raspberry pi logo
    o) amount currently raised.
    Then underneath
    o) example of testimonial
    o) button asking for feedback

[enter your id] text box font size is same as [start coding] button font size
perhaps to the right of [do a review] I could show a mini image of the dashboard
perhaps resume-coding could be a mini-image of the started animals!
I like the idea of getting some pictures of the animals on the home page.
create_an_id is hyperlink
repeat is hyperlink
resume_coding is hyperlink
publish is hyperlink
