Invent special comment syntax/es that could be placed
in visible/invisible files.
The syntax would allow recording of helpfull URLs
eg c/c++/make references.
If these are detected then the are created as hyperlinks
in the [test] page. Perhaps below the file knave?
They could be "pinged" to see if they are still live.
Or maybe they could be accessible via a [useful links] popup.
