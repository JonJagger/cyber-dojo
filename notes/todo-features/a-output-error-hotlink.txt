OUTPUT-HOTLINK (7)
  if output file is selected
    hot key (ALT-E perhaps) causes...
    javascript to matches the output for *first*
      file+line-number in error message (in pattern of output)
    auto opens that file
    scrolls to the line-number.
  Why require output file to be selected?
  Require only that there is an error in the output file.
  That takes care of itself - the pattern matches or it doesn't.
