Started from Linux Server iso image
http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server

Created new Guest in VirtualBox, called git-server, type=Linux, accepted settings
Clicked it to start and it asked for the image
Pointed it to the iso image I downloaded.
Responded to all the questions to setup the server.
Created a user called jon with usual password (sudoer)

Kept network settings as NAT (to enable downloads)
//need Host-only-adapter for local network.

First fixed keyboard
$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
On 1st step look for Apple option in list but then
*also* look for apple option in subsequent list.

Note
----
In VirtualBox on MacBook Pro to get the git-server and the cyber-dojo
server both running with host-only-adapter and not have the same IP
address I had to tweak one of them so its apparent mac address
was different to the other one. I cloned one server from the other.
