Want to install docker-machine on the main server.

$ ssh root@cyber-dojo.org
$ docker --version
Docker version 1.1.1, build bd609d2

$ cat /etc/issue
Debian GNU/Linux 7 \n \l
# Debian 7 is Wheezy

$ uname -r
3.2.0-4-amd64

No. Decided to do it on the backup server. Debian 8, Jessie, kernel 3.16 (Docker needs >3.8)
Then rsync from main-server and switch IP address to new one.
But backup server has only got 100G file system. Don't think that's big enough.
On main server
$ df -i
Yes inodes are near 50% now.

So build a new server. No wait. There are two issue.
1) have area to work towards docker-machine on
2) have Debian 8 based server ready to switch over to (rsync from main server)
The current 100G backup server is enough for 1)

So updating docker on backup server.
I'm following https://docs.docker.com/installation/debian/
Step 9 fails
$ apt-get update
says
E: The method driver /usr/lib/apt/methods/https could not be found.
N: Is the package apt-transport-https installed?
So trying
$ apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
And again
$ apt-get update
Yup that's better
$ apt-cache policy docker-engine
docker-engine:
  Installed: (none)

But
$ docker --version
-bash: /usr/bin/docker: No such file or directory

Do I have to do next section?
Yes
Note docker-engine != docker-machine
$ apt-get install -y docker-engine

Now
$ docker --version
Says
Docker version 1.8.3, build f4bf5c7

Now to install docker-engine

I'm following https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/

$ curl -L https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.4.0/docker-machine_linux-amd64 > /usr/local/bin/docker-machine

$ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine

$ docker-machine --version
docker-machine version 0.4.0 (9d0dc7a)


Ok. I have a base platform.
Reboot server and check cyber-dojo still comes up.
Nope. 54.74.18.114 into browser and I get
  We're sorry, but something went wrong.
  We've been notified about this issue and we'll take a look at it shortly.
Googling seems to reveal its a Rails/Passenger issue.

$ cd /var/www/cyber-dojo
$ bundle install
And yes we are up.
$ ./admin_scripts/pull.sh
Still all ok.

So now to do docker-creates....


====================================================================================


Should I start rsync'ing from main-server to new-server-work-in-progress.
I guess I should install cyber-dojo and docker on it first. Capture the
commands needed to do that and put them in a script. At least check old
script still work ok.

Ok. Fell over. open4 not installed.
Need to do bundle-install etc before updating caches...
Ok. fixed that. pushed it.
$ pull.sh $
$ pull.sh

Now of course at this point it says docker and docker-machine are not installed.
Script setup_turnkey_server.sh only has instructions for docker and looks
out of date.

Verify Turnkey page come up if I put ip address into browser.
Lets try first bit of setup_turnkey_server.sh to check apache2.
-------
cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
sed 's/www.html/www\/cyber-dojo\/public/' < 000-default.conf > cyber-dojo.conf
sed 's/www.html/www\/cyber-dojo\/public/' < default-ssl.conf > cyber-dojo-ssl.conf

cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
ln -s ../sites-available/cyber-dojo.conf cyber-dojo.conf

chown    www-data:www-data /var
chown    www-data:www-data /var/www
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/cyber-dojo

cd /var/www/cyber-dojo
chmod g+s katas

a2ensite cyber-dojo
a2dissite railsapp
service apache2 reload
-------
Yes we are up.

Now for new instructions for docker.
Trying these
-------
#!/bin/bash
apt-get purge lxc-docker*
apt-get purge docker.io*
apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu:80 --recv-keys 58118E89F3A912897C070ADBF76221572C52609D
echo "deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo debian-jessie main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
apt-get update
apt-cache policy docker-engine
apt-get install -y docker-engine
curl -L https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.4.0/docker-machine_linux-amd64 > /usr/local/bin/docker-machine
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine
-------
pgp failed with
gpg: requesting key 2C52609D from hkp server pgp.mit.edu

And at the end installing docker-engine with

$ docker --version
Nope
$ docker-machine --version
0.4.0 it is there


Trying to run pgp again. Directly from command line.
This time it worked!
Ran script again.
pgp failed again.
Googling. Switched to different server.
hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80
Seems more reliable.

Now to install some containers.
$ docker pull cyberdojofoundation/java-1.8_junit

Re ran pull.sh
Says docker is installed
Says docker-machine is installed

Back to server in browser.
Yes. create page allows me to create java-junit dojo.
Enter it.
Hit test.
Says
Post http:///var/run/docker.sock/v1.20/containers/create: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: permission denied.
* Are you trying to connect to a TLS-enabled daemon without TLS?
* Is your docker daemon up and running?


How can I tell if the docker daemon is running?
$ /etc/init.d/docker status

Yup its running.
