-------------------------------------------
building your own docker language container
-------------------------------------------
o) choose a base-container to build on top of.
   For example cyberdojo/build-essential
   at https://index.docker.io/u/cyberdojo/
o) write a dockerfile containing all the
   commands (eg apt-get install's) required.
   For example /languages/C#-NUnit/Dockerfile_csharp_nunit
o) use the dockerfile to build your container
   For example
   $ docker build -t cyberdojo/my_container .
   which creates a new container called cyberdojo/my_container
   using the dockerfile in the current folder (.)
o) fire up the new container in interactive mode
   $ docker run -i -t cyberdojo/my_container /bin/bash
   Try it out!

CUT FROM README (AFFECTED BY DOCKER)
Check that running cyber-dojo.sh behaves as required:
  #sudo -u www-data ./cyber-dojo.sh
or maybe
  #strace sudo -u www-data ./cyber-dojo.sh

You can test the setup of a new language using a ruby script.
For example: if the new language is Lisp installed
at cyberdojo/test/cyberdojo/languages/Lisp then
  #cd test/installation
  #ruby check_language.rb ../cyberdojo Lisp
Once this passes make it live by moving it to the live languages folder:
#mv cyberdojo/test/cyberdojo/languages/Lisp cyberdojo/languages/Lisp

Refactoring dojos
  Put tennis ones into zip / tar.gz ?
  ...
  Write script to unzip and ensure chown/chgrp www-data
  ...
  Auto unzip refactoring dojos after a prune_small/large true
  ...
  Add refactoring button on front page and its dialog has all
  refactoring URLs below

19th Feb 2014: On cyber-dojo.com ran
  > ruby prune_small.rb true 3 7
    2764 katas deleted
    5783 katas not deleted
  >df
  reports no inodes regained?
  Wrong partition!
  Fixed etc/fstab so instead of
      /mnt/katas /var/www/cyberdojo/katas
      it does
      /mnt/cyberdojo /var/www/cyberdojo
  which transfers about 7G from the 10G-fs to the 100G-fs :-)
  that is much better.
  ...
  Copied tar.gz files back from cyber-katas to cyber-dojo.com
  Now untarring them on cyber-dojo.com
    find . -name '*.tar.gz' -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 tar xf
  Getting some errors...
    gzip: stdin: not in gzip format
    tar: Child returned status 1
    tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors
  Need to find out which ids are causing failures and why.
  Moved them back to separate downloads folder.
  ...
  The xfer.rb script could take the URL as a parameter.
  Will probably want to xfer in both directions.

LINE-NUMBERS
  Dynamically change width from <99 to 100+
  Make the left padding on the line-numbers (on test page)

Only offering installed languages
...
The intention is (maybe) to use a specific structure for the contents of the
languages' manifests to enable an automated check to see what is correctly
installed and working, and to only offer installed and working languages when
you setup a new coding practice. At the moment when you setup a
new coding practice all languages/ subfolders are offered.

You can test if a languages' initial fileset is correctly setup as follows
>cd cyberdojo/test/installation
>ruby installation_tests.rb

For each language...
o) cyber-dojo searches through its manifests' :visible_filenames,
   in sequence, looking for any that contain the string '42'
o) If it doesn't find any it will report than language is not
   configured correcty.
o) If it finds at least one file containing '42' it will pick the
   first one as "the-42-file"
o) It will then use the manifest to [create a kata and run-the-tests]
   three times as follows:
   test-1 - with the files unchanged.
   test-2 - with the 42 in the-42-file replaced by 54
   test-3 - with the 42 replaced by 4typo2
o) If test-1 generates a red traffic-light and
      test-2 generates a green traffic-light and
      test-3 generates an amber traffic-light then
   then it will assume the language is installed and working.
o) If the three tests return three amber traffic-lights then
   it will assume the language is not configured correctly.
o) If the three tests return any other combination of traffic-lights
   it will assume the language is installed but not working.

This approach has a flaw: two or more files can contain '42'...
This tends to happen for BDD style testing.
