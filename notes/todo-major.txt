I'd like an automated process that moves dojos that have
a minimum number of traffic lights and are at least N days
old onto a separate read-only cyber-dojo server. 
Ideally, one that has a list of id's not to delete (eg the
refactoring dojo's ids). Info about these dojos' would be stored
in a database holding various details such as id, language, exercise,
animals, each animals traffic-light count, etc.
$ruby prune_large.rb false 25 14
reveals 1,947 katas with dojos having 25 or more traffic-lights.
http://cyber-dojo.com could offer a button to 'export' a dojo.
This would call a method on the read-only server passing the id.
The read-only server would respond by getting the id.tar.gz file via
a wget on http://cyber-dojo.com/dashboard/download/id
------------------------------------------------------
Suppose in dojo-X the frog forked from traffic-light 28
whose git hash was 2d0d2bb21ad7....
In the new dojo-Y the alligators first traffic-light will *not*
have the same hash because a git hash depends not only on the
content but on the history and date/time etc.
Even if it didn't depend on the history the content is not
exactly the same. This is because..
  o) the output file usually contains timing info.
  o) the output file's content is also in manifest.rb (which is git commited)
  o) increments.rb contains a date-time-stamp of each test
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
However, I could create a separate sha1 hash of the "genuine" files.
Where genuine files are visible_files - [output]
Then the hash of dojo-X frog 28 would be the same as dojo-Y alligator 1
This would allow me to store these hashes in a database table and to
be able to know when any file's content has occured before (either through
a fork or coincidentally).
So a database table would need to be something like
  CREATE TABLE digests (
    sha1 CHAR(40) NOT NULL,         # '8b45e4bd1c6acb88bebf6407d16205f567e62a3e'
    id CHAR(10) NOT NULL,           # '7D2111A7D0'
    animal VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,    # 'hippo'
    light INT,                      # 14'th traffic-light
    filename VARCHAR(127) NOT NULL, # 'fizz_buzz.hpp'
    CONSTRAINT pk PRIMARY KEY (id,animal,light,filename)
  )
  CREATE INDEX sha1_index ON digests (sha1)
- - - - -
This could also give me a way to catalogue all the initial starting positions.
This is useful since some exercises have changed their names and this causes
problems with forking.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
For the hashing I could use
  require 'digest/sha1'
  Digest::SHA1.hexdigest("some string") -> "8b45e4bd1c6acb88bebf6407d16205f567e62a3e"
  Would need a test to make sure the sha1 of a known string did not change (eg when
  upgrading Rails or Ruby)
------------------------------------------------------
Store data in json format not inspect format.
Or maybe there is a library offering a restricted eval method? Doubt it.
One option is to switch to storing (eg manifest) in manifest.json
And also to change the code that reads back. If .json file exists
then we use that. If not we rely on .rb file and eval that.
o) Install json save/read (with eval read backup) on cyber-dojo.com
   Don't need to do immediately
o) Write script to convert all existing dojos from .rb to json format.
   This will be some work. Eg increments.rb is saved with *each* commit.
   May need to simulate each commit again.
o) Copy all cyber-dojo.com dojos to new read-only server
o) Do the conversion on read-only server (so as not to drain cpu on main server)
   and ensure everything is saved in json format.
o) Forward review ids from cyber-dojo.com to read-only server...?
   On read-only server have json method 'dojo/valid_id'
   On cyber-dojo.com call this (in javascript) and if id exists
   then open a dashboard on the readonly server. Otherwise see if
   the id is on cyber-dojo.com (and if it is open dashboard there).
   This means the start/resume buttons should only be enabled if the
   id is valid on cyber-dojo.com
   The review button should be enabled if the id is valid on
   either cyber-dojo.com or the readonly server.
   Thus ids for harvested dojos (whose id is *only* on the readonly server)
   will only enable the review button.
o) Delete all old eval saved dojos from cyber-dojo.com
o) Use pure json save/read on cyber-dojo.com
A lot of work, but the result is no evals on the read-only server.
------------------------------------------------------
It will also mean the manifests for all languages and exercises
will need to be JSON'd ... but not, I don't think, on the readonly server.
DiskFile.rb could go from
  File.open(pathed_filename, 'w') { |file|
    file.write(object.inspect + "\n")
  }
to
  File.open(pathed_filename, 'w') { |file|
      file.write(JSON.unparse(object) + "\n")
    }
  }

And the filename will need changing on the calling side too.
Eg increments.rb to increments.json
Strategies?

 o) on cyber-katas.com
 o)   harvest dojos from cyber-dojo.com
 o)   write script to convert them to JSON
 o)   create database
 o)   write script to parse JSON'd dojos and populate database
 o)   create index page which feeds off database
 o)   verify dashboard and diff-dialog works ok
 o)   use git branch for this work
 o)   only problem is harvested dojos still need initial evals
 o)   that's why second part of the work is...
 
 o) on cyber-dojo.com
 o)   support inspect on old dojos
 o)   but use JSON on new dojos
 o)     ***can I do this***?
 o)     languages?
 o)     exercises?
 o)     forking?
 o)     resuming?
 o)   install
 o)   harvest all dojos to cyber-katas
 o)   convert them to JSON on cyber-katas as above
 o)   forward [review]s to cyber-katas (not button on test page?)
 
 
------------------------------------------------------
url = 'http://cyber-katas.org/dojo/valid_id'
$.getJSON(url, { id: id }).done(function(theId) {
  if (theId.exists) {
    ...
  }
});
------------------------------------------------------
Look into using PStore instead of DiskFile?
------------------------------------------------------
Offer a fork button on the diff-dialog?
