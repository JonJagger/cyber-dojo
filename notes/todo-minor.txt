HELP
  put in content for dashboard help. At least mention being
  able to press any traffic-light to get a diff.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
DIFF-PAGE
  redirect URL to dashboard with diff-dialog opened to the diff as
  specified in the URL
  This also means I won't need the diff-heartbeat code.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
DIFF-DIALOG
  red/green buttons are not dimmed on unselected filenames
  (they are on the dialog page).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
DIFF-DIALOG
  if you press < > and the next diff has no actual diff
  then repeat (atuomatically) the < > until you get an actual diff?
  I think it might be better to simply not allow a [test] when
  there is no diff in the browser.

FAVICON
Make the favicon for [test] page be a bulb of the current colour?

chip away at help tool-tips.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
chip away at internationalisation. Have promises for Russian and Ukranian.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
MISC
  add ghosting when traffic-light is hovered over.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
SETUP
  use a dialog?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
DIFF-SHOW (redudant when diff-page becomes diff-dialog)
  make it appear same as diff-dialog
  o) add tagGap between wasTag and nowTag
  o) move animal image between << < and > >>
  o) lose line-numbers
  o) add (?) button

TOOL-TIPS
  needed for fork/review/diff dialog << < > >> buttons 
  Also, tips on the setup page.
  Make the tip appear next to the element it is tipping?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
DIFF/REVERT/FORK DIALOGS
  add css to control height and scrollbar-y of filename-list
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
DIALOGS
  change .close() calls to .remove()

ZIP
Make sure the zip download works. That is gets all of the files.
This could be because `system` calls are asynchronous.
Apparently no. It is already synchronous. And the command it
calls must also be synchronous too of course.

RESUME/FORK? FROM RENAMED LANGUAGE
http://localhost:3000/kata/edit/11870BBD9F?avatar=elephant
This will not resume.
   lib/DiskFile.rb:27:in `read'
   lib/DiskFile.rb:27:in `read'
   app/models/language.rb:58:in `manifest'
   app/models/language.rb:48:in `tab_size'
   app/models/language.rb:44:in `tab'
   app/controllers/kata_controller.rb:11:in `edit'
The reason is its trying to load
/Users/jonjagger/Desktop/Repos/cyberdojo/languages/Java-ApprovalTests/manifest.rb
But the name of the language has changed from
Java-ApprovalTests
to
Java-Approval
I think this is overly brittle. There is no reason I can see for
an existing practice to have a dependency on the language fileset
it was created from.
I thought that files named in the manifest linked. Perhaps this is
an old practice session and the files were not linked for it.
If they are linked and you attempt to delete the original what happens?
The linking is irrelevant. The name of the folder is a string in the manifest.
models/kata.rb
64  def language
65    Language.new(@root_dir, manifest[:language])
66  end
so it's getting the language name from the kata's manifest
This is the manifest from the kata. Not the animal.
I think a better option  may be to create a "dummy" animal and each
animal simply gets a copy of the language files as it's starting files.
Would that affect the ability to clone from a given position?

feedback from Derek Graham.
o) devs seem very reluctant to change the names of the untitled. files
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
At the moment the instructions come from exercises/ and
everything else comes from languages/ via manifest.rb
This means if I want to create a special exercise with
:highlight_filenames I have to do it as an exercise.
That's nuts. How to solve this? Whacky idea...
Have a null-object entry for language and put everything
you want into a custom exercise which includes the language.

get the error/404/500 pages working so that they appear when there is a fault.
I tried this and got it to work by adding a config file setting to make fault
handling be done by routes.rb and then adding a match for 404 and 500 which
forwarded to an error_controller. This worked but it lost all the images
(in the other pages). Is the problem here that rails 3 puts public images in
a different folder than before?

------------------------------------------------------------
split external-lib off into separate folder
and create separate test/external-lib too.
Also add filter for coverage of test/external-lib.

Add tests for DiskGit
Add tests for DiskFile
Add/move tests for Uuid
Add/move tests for TimeboxedTask

It would be simpler if output and instructions were not mixed
into kata.language and avatar.setup did an explicit
save(kata.exercise.instructions)

app/helpers
  not enough coverage on
    translation_helper.rb
    application_helper.rb
  
app/controllers
  application_controller.set_locale
  locales_controller.change
  
//----------------------------------
After this maybe the test cycle will be fast enough to install
o) C++ GTest
o) C++ CATCH
o) scala
//----------------------------------
What external resources do I use? Which could be seamed and mocked to speed up testing?
o) any system() call or backtick call
   mkdir -p
   uuid
   cd
   cyber-dojo.sh with all its variations!?
   kill

Thinking about how I could reduce the number of clicks to get started...
Suppose there were 4 rooms, each of a different colour.
Then players would not need to type in an ID. The room could have an ID
which they could use to get back to the session at a later time.
But at the start one person configures the blue room and then all the
players have to do is press the start button in the blue room.
Then they get a dialog saying "You are the panda". And you have to click
the ok button. Could I get rid of even that? Instead of a start button you
could have 16 animal buttons and you have to choose your animal by clicking it.
This also opens up the potential for not doing a setup, and then if you click
an animal, you get a random language+exercise combination.
The downside of this, of course, is that the blue room could be full when you
want to join it. But the upside is tremendous. You can see what people are
doing all the time without needing an ID.
I think this approach would definitely need each room to have a time-limit.
That way the room would become free again some time later.
Would mean the room-session could also have a name.
How about allowing a session to be either public or private.
If it's public then you can click a refresh button in your chosen room
(or ideally it appears all by itself) and a button for your session,
with its language,exercise,name,id is displayed. Click on it and you start.
This would also allow a history of previous sessions (by room perhaps).
Also, at the setup page, you could show all sessions that match the combination
you have chosen. And you could view those.
Or here's a possibly nice variation. Instead of public/private.
Have only public. But if you want you can delay (say by 1 hour) the public
appearance of the id.
Obviously a big design criteria for having private IDs is that it means
I don't really have to worry about 2+ computers using the same animal
at the same time. The resume feature means this is a definite possibility
if the ID is public.
