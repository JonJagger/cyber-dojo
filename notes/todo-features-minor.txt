EXERCISE-HAS-MANIFEST
  At the moment the instructions come from exercises/ and
  everything else comes from languages/ via manifest.rb
  This means if I want to create a special exercise with
  :highlight_filenames I have to do it as an exercise.
  And then I have to know to select it only with a specific language.
  How about allowing a language folder to have its own exercise folders.
  And give Exercise a manifest like Language?

CUSTOM-DOMAIN-NAMES
  James spins up custom names for clients
  eg  cisco.cyber-dojo.org - from amazon route 53
  Nice idea.

REPEAT
  next to the [setup] button have a [repeat] button
  which automatically sets up a new dojo with the same
  language and exercise as last time.
