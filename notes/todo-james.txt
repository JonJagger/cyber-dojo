ROGUE-CHARACTERS-ON-INPUT (3)
  in Avatar.rb the output is encoded to strip rogue characters.
  Sometimes you get these rogue characters on input.
  So what I really need to do is to strip the rogue characters on INPUT!
  Shift-Alt-T will put a rogue character in to generate a test. Eg in a ruby file.
  One option is to filter the input on each character press in the browser.

  Note this will not handle pasted-in code.
  ...
  var isPrintable = function(e) {
      return e.which !== 0 &&
      e.charCode !== 0 &&
      !e.ctrlKey &&
      !e.metaKey &&
      !e.altKey
  }
  $("input").keypress(function (e) {
      if (!isPrintable(e)) {
          e.preventDefault();
      }
  });

OUTPUT-HOTLINK (7)
  if output file is selected
    hot key (ALT-E perhaps) causes...
    javascript to matches the output for *first*
      file+line-number in error message (in pattern of output)
    auto opens that file
    scrolls to the line-number.
  Why require output file to be selected.
  Require only that there is an error in the output file.
  That takes care of itself - the pattern matches or it doesn't.

SEARCH-REPLACE (15)
  button just below new/rename/delete
  opens dialog
  files?  defaults to current file, can enter regex if you want
  --search-for: defaults to content selected in editor (or "")
  replace-with: defaults to content selected in editor (or "")
  both have dropdown history
  and [button]
  SED ?
  As you enter the search pattern the filenames listed
  are dynamically enabled/disabled (checkboxes). Or shown/not-shown?
  Show a count of how many matches the search-for regex has for each file
  And if you don't hit replace, then this gives you a way
  to search!
  Should the filenames displayed be all the files, or
  if highlighted files are marked, only the marked ones?
  Hmmmm. No, because the files the dev creates are bound to be
  the ones they want to search inside.
  Also, is output included in the filename list? No. Its readonly
  Also, is cyber-dojo.sh included in the filename list?

EXTRA-INFO (20)
  on the animal display (eg on dashboard) show the number of passing
  tests (if at green). This is very useful for situations in
  exercises where you pre-create all the tests and the task
  is to work through them.
