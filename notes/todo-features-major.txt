Finer-grained commits
  do a commit when an animal switches from one file
  to another file. This would allow you to see if the first code
  entered was code or test code. And also file navigation.
  The diff << < > >> controls would need to be expanded.
  One possible design...
  o) each movement causes a new tag-commit with a new tag number
  o) each [test] does the same
  o) << < > >> controls move along tag numbers
  o) < red > moves to prev/next red
  o) < amber > moves to prev/next amber
  o) < green > moves to prev/next amber
  o) < RAG > moves to prev/next light
  Issue: If you make an edit then switch files, then press [test]
  there would be no actual diff in source files. However,
  the server could still do a [test] to generate an output file.
  Even if this output file is exactly the same as before, the
  server will still put a new light into increments.rb so there
  will be a commit+tag.
  Issue: If you switch files and there has been no edit, again
  there would be no actual diff in the source files. However,
  I could create an tag-commits.json file (like increments.rb) that
  simply stores the event causing the commit. The event would be
    o) switch file
    o) new file
    o) rename file
    o) delete file
    o) [test]

  Possible design of new << < > >> navigator
  Add third type of < > button.
  One whose triangle is not filled in.
  This would move one tag-commit event. Above this would still be
  the editable tag numbers and the lights
   This suggests puting the < > buttons underneath the tags
   (which they work on) and the the <| |> buttons underneath
   the lights (which they work on)
   Move animal image. Repeat count and pie chart from dashboard.
   Add tag-commit count.
       11 (pie) [lion] 92
            light |tag| |tag| light
        <<||   <|    <   >    |>    ||>
   Also add tag-number to each light.
       11 (pie) [lion] 92
        tag-light |tag| |tag| light-tag
        <<||   <|    <   >    |>    ||>

  Reduce size of tag input-edits. The most common navigation
  by far is using the << < > >> buttons.

  This raises the idea of *not* trying to open the
  'most changed file' when you navigate. Instead
  open the file that was the one switched to. This is
  simpler and perhaps more in keeping with the review aspect.
  It means the file could be cyber-dojo.sh or output.
  It also suggests recording the scroll-position of the
  file when it is re-played. This allows you to see
  exactly what the player saw when they switched to that file.

  The dashboard could also show two numbers, the big one (number
  of lights) and a small one (number of tags).
       11 (pie) [lion] 92

  Also suggests extending the domain model.
  avatar.lights[n]
  avatar.tags[n]

  What about revert/fork dialogs?
  Allow forking from a light or a tag?
  What about backward compatibility?
  Will the light/tag distinction collapse silently
  for reviewing dojos done before the tag-commits?

timed-out katas
  the more I think about it the more I realize that having
  dojos non-resumable after 2 hours from the first traffic-light
  is a good idea. It also ties in with the idea of making a
  second read-only server. It may help to solve language
  rename awkwardness a little too.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
quick-start  code-pad
  No exercise. You just press the language and you automatically
    get an id and an animal.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
user-identification
  don't store the user's id. Store a hash of it.
  Allow a session to be tagged with a users hashed-id.
  No need to store any sensitive data.
  With this I can create a user-dashboard showing a history
  of previous dojos. This allows a comparison of dojo to dojo.
  This could be powerful in showing improvement.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
hash-ids
  For the collection of files to see if there are duplicates...
  don't base the hash on files that are not relevant
  eg makefile, Makefile, cyber-dojo.sh
  Hmmm. It would also be useful to store hashes for
  individual files. It might well happen that although
  the combination of files has never been seen before
  one (or more) of the source files has occured before.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
sytax-highlighting
  make it toggleable, like line-numbers?
  by default syntax-highlighting is off.
  CodeMirror?
  This would provide a possible architecture for storing the
  individual keystrokes (replay in animation style)

o) refactor so new katas save sha1 hashes
   and also put URL of server dojo into kata's manifest.
   Old dojos are still usable in old format.

o) write a script to convert a dojo in old-rb format into new-json format
   This will need to detect if the :language named in the katas manifest.rb
   (not the animals manifest) still exists on the server.
   If it does not then it could be the language has been
     - renamed
     - deleted (eg Objective-C)
   If its renamed patch the language name to the new name.
   Run it on all dojos already xferred to cyber-katas.org
   This means checking for language exist/rename/delete information
   will need to come from a .json file and not by looking at the actual server.
   If language has been renamed the information would be useful for the
      fork feature on cyber-dojo. It can intercept and patch the language name
   If the language has been deleted the information would also be useful
      since it means I cannot attempt the fork.
   If language is patched - will cyber-katas still be able to
   detect the fork from the sha1's? It needs to be able to.
   So sha1's must be solely from file contents. Sounds ok.

o) add buttons on cyber-dojo to publish a dojo to cyber-kata with tags
   on the sending server check format of dojo
   if its old-rb format then convert it *in-place* (on sending server) using script above
   send it in new-json format (tar.gz) to cyber-katas

o) can offer fork on cyber-katas if I know URL of originating dojo
   can make with $.getJSON('forker/fork'...) to it

o) this means we could get a cycle
  I publish a dojo
  Someone else links back to my dojo and adds some more traffic-lights
  Suppose they then *re*publish it!
  That should be allowed. It would be cool!
  Does create issues.
  Can't assume that inserted database information will be new
  Could be information that already exists.
  Re-publish event could add new tags.
  Tags should be recorded with the publish-event not the dojo.
  Can then see a history of "tags" added.
  Allow tags to be editable on cyber-katas?
  Want re-publish of unchanged dojo to be low-overhead
  Should be enough to check, URL,id,animals,traffic-lights per animal.

o) another problem is it opens up the possibility of
   two people trying to edit the same code at the same time
   as the same animal.
   This implies that if you click from cyber-katas to get back to
   the original dojo you should not go back to the original.
   You should never see the original's ID. Instead you should
   auto-fork and thus get a new ID. Sharing the new ID it is now your decision.
   This is great but it means it will require database+code using sha1's to
   figure out which old traffic-light the new dojo was forked from.
   New dojo will not be tied to old dojo until new dojo is published back
   onto cyber-katas

o) dojos that have had their language name changed cannot be forked.
   Need to fix this.
   Or at least detect it and either
      not publish them on cyber-katas.org
      or figure out what the new name is and patch
   Do patching on the old->new conversion?
   No since there could still be post publish name changes.

o) be careful not to expose the ids of the original dojos
   when viewing diffs on cyber-katas.org
   Create a simple fake-id->id mapping table.

o) if traffic-light's files' hashes match traffic-light 1 for
   other dojo(s) then those other dojos were forked from this
   traffic-light. Could simply offer a count of this on dashboard/diff
   Or simpler, a mark which can reveal information about the forks.
   if traffic-light's files' hashes match other traffic-lights for
   this dojo then reverts have occured.

o) open cyber-katas.org


------------------------------------------------------
I'd like an automated process that moves dojos that have
a minimum number of traffic lights and are at least N days
old onto a separate read-only cyber-dojo server.
Ideally, one that has a list of id's not to delete (eg the
refactoring dojo's ids). Info about these dojos' would be stored
in a database holding various details such as id, language, exercise,
animals, each animals traffic-light count, etc.
$ruby prune_large.rb false 25 14
reveals 1,947 katas with dojos having 25 or more traffic-lights.
http://cyber-dojo.com could offer a button to 'export' a dojo.
This would call a method on the read-only server passing the id.
The read-only server would respond by getting the id.tar.gz file via
a wget on http://cyber-dojo.com/dashboard/download/id
------------------------------------------------------
Suppose in dojo-X the frog forked from traffic-light 28
whose git hash was 2d0d2bb21ad7....
In the new dojo-Y the alligators first traffic-light will *not*
have the same hash because a git hash depends not only on the
content but on the history and date/time etc.
Even if it didn't depend on the history the content is not
exactly the same. This is because..
  o) the output file usually contains timing info.
  o) the output file's content is also in manifest.rb (which is git commited)
  o) increments.rb contains a date-time-stamp of each test
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
However, I could create a separate sha1 hash of the "genuine" files.
Where genuine files are visible_files - [output]
Then the hash of dojo-X frog 28 would be the same as dojo-Y alligator 1
This would allow me to store these hashes in a database table and to
be able to know when any file's content has occured before (either through
a fork or coincidentally).
So a database table would need to be something like
  CREATE TABLE digests (
    sha1 CHAR(40) NOT NULL,         # '8b45e4bd1c6acb88bebf6407d16205f567e62a3e'
    id CHAR(10) NOT NULL,           # '7D2111A7D0'
    animal VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,    # 'hippo'
    light INT,                      # 14'th traffic-light
    filename VARCHAR(127) NOT NULL, # 'fizz_buzz.hpp'
    CONSTRAINT pk PRIMARY KEY (id,animal,light,filename)
  )
  CREATE INDEX sha1_index ON digests (sha1)
- - - - -
This could also give me a way to catalogue all the initial starting positions.
This is useful since some exercises have changed their names and this causes
problems with forking.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
For the hashing I could use
  require 'digest/sha1'
  Digest::SHA1.hexdigest("some string") -> "8b45e4bd1c6acb88bebf6407d16205f567e62a3e"
  Would need a test to make sure the sha1 of a known string did not change (eg when
  upgrading Rails or Ruby)
------------------------------------------------------
Store data in json format not inspect format.
Or maybe there is a library offering a restricted eval method? Doubt it.
One option is to switch to storing (eg manifest) in manifest.json
And also to change the code that reads back. If .json file exists
then we use that. If not we rely on .rb file and eval that.
o) Install json save/read (with eval read backup) on cyber-dojo.com
   Don't need to do immediately
o) Write script to convert all existing dojos from .rb to json format.
   This will be some work. Eg increments.rb is saved with *each* commit.
   May need to simulate each commit again.
o) Copy all cyber-dojo.com dojos to new read-only server
o) Do the conversion on read-only server (so as not to drain cpu on main server)
   and ensure everything is saved in json format.
o) Forward review ids from cyber-dojo.com to read-only server...?
   On read-only server have json method 'dojo/valid_id'
   On cyber-dojo.com call this (in javascript) and if id exists
   then open a dashboard on the readonly server. Otherwise see if
   the id is on cyber-dojo.com (and if it is open dashboard there).
   This means the start/resume buttons should only be enabled if the
   id is valid on cyber-dojo.com
   The review button should be enabled if the id is valid on
   either cyber-dojo.com or the readonly server.
   Thus ids for harvested dojos (whose id is *only* on the readonly server)
   will only enable the review button.
o) Delete all old eval saved dojos from cyber-dojo.com
o) Use pure json save/read on cyber-dojo.com
A lot of work, but the result is no evals on the read-only server.
------------------------------------------------------
It will also mean the manifests for all languages and exercises
will need to be JSON'd ... but not, I don't think, on the readonly server.
DiskFile.rb could go from
  File.open(pathed_filename, 'w') { |file|
    file.write(object.inspect)
  }
to
  File.open(pathed_filename, 'w') { |file|
      file.write(JSON.unparse(object))
    }
  }

And the filename will need changing on the calling side too.
Eg increments.rb to increments.json
Strategies?

 o) on cyber-katas.com
 o)   harvest dojos from cyber-dojo.com
 o)   write script to convert them to JSON
 o)   create database
 o)   write script to parse JSON'd dojos and populate database
 o)   create index page which feeds off database
 o)   verify dashboard and diff-dialog works ok
 o)   use git branch for this work
 o)   only problem is harvested dojos still need initial evals
 o)   that's why second part of the work is...

 o) on cyber-dojo.com
 o)   support inspect on old dojos
 o)   but use JSON on new dojos
 o)     ***can I do this***?
 o)     languages?
 o)     exercises?
 o)     forking?
 o)     resuming?
 o)   install
 o)   harvest all dojos to cyber-katas
 o)   convert them to JSON on cyber-katas as above
 o)   forward [review]s to cyber-katas (not button on test page?)


------------------------------------------------------
url = 'http://cyber-katas.org/dojo/valid_id'
$.getJSON(url, { id: id }).done(function(theId) {
  if (theId.exists) {
    ...
  }
});

READONLY PRACTICE VIEW WITH VOTING
  Start to think about opening up the done katas so people
  can see them and vote on them.

ANIMATION
  keeping on the same file and showing its content in a rapid
  sequence of updates would be a nice feature?
  Do on dialog not showing diffs.
  Reduce font a lot so you can see outline. Auto? Slider-control?
  Stay on same file.
  Would be even better if it could detect a rename.

4-DOJO-ROOMS-TO-LIMIT-CONCURRENT-USE
Thinking about how I could reduce the number of clicks to get started...
Suppose there were 4 rooms, each of a different colour.
Then players would not need to type in an ID. The room could have an ID
which they could use to get back to the session at a later time.
But at the start one person configures the blue room and then all the
players have to do is press the start button in the blue room.
Then they get a dialog saying "You are the panda". And you have to click
the ok button. Could I get rid of even that? Instead of a start button you
could have 16 animal buttons and you have to choose your animal by clicking it.
This also opens up the potential for not doing a setup, and then if you click
an animal, you get a random language+exercise combination.
The downside of this, of course, is that the blue room could be full when you
want to join it. But the upside is tremendous. You can see what people are
doing all the time without needing an ID.
I think this approach would definitely need each room to have a time-limit.
That way the room would become free again some time later.
Would mean the room-session could also have a name.
How about allowing a session to be either public or private.
If it's public then you can click a refresh button in your chosen room
(or ideally it appears all by itself) and a button for your session,
with its language,exercise,name,id is displayed. Click on it and you start.
This would also allow a history of previous sessions (by room perhaps).
Also, at the setup page, you could show all sessions that match the combination
you have chosen. And you could view those.
Or here's a possibly nice variation. Instead of public/private.
Have only public. But if you want you can delay (say by 1 hour) the public
appearance of the id.
Obviously a big design criteria for having private IDs is that it means
I don't really have to worry about 2+ computers using the same animal
at the same time. The resume feature means this is a definite possibility
if the ID is public.
