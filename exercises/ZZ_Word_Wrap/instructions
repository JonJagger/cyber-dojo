Write a function wordwrap(longline, width) that takes
a string and an integer and returns a string,
following these rules:

- Assume the string contains only printable
  characters and blanks,  but no control characters.
- Assume that width is at least 3
- The result must preserve all printable characters
- The result contains additional newline characters
  such that it describes as few lines as possible
  but no line is longer than width
- Break lines at a blank if possible.
  Do so by replacing the blank with a newline

Task 1:
As described above

Task 2:
Ditto, but alternatively break at a dash if that
leads to a better result (a longer line).
Do not replace the dash, rather add the newline
behind it.

Task 3:
Ditto, but additionally suppress leading blanks
on each line except the first.
