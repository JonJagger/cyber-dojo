Add file for OSX too (sw_vers is the command)
On OSX Docker-Quickstart-Terminal you will need to...
$ docker-machine ssh default
run commands from there (which ones? what is default based on?)
Answer=Tiny Core. Has sh not bash

Checkout the procedure on a Windows box too

Auto-detect which version of linux I'm on (lsb_release) ?

Does pull.sh still do an image update check?
It still calls caches/refresh_all.sh *after* the git pull.
So refresh_all could be updated to reinstate the image update.

Also, this way I don't double the number of images on the hub.

There is a --tmpfs option on docker run. Look into that.
https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/containers/dockervolumes/ (look for :z)

volume mount has ro,rw and also other options, eg z for sharing.
https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/containers/dockervolumes/ (look for z option)

The kata data container suffers from the same problem as the
tmp data container. It does not seem possible to limit the runner's
view of it to just its sub-folder.
So it seems volume mounting katas from the outside is back on the cards.

0. instructions on installing dind server. On new Blog page.

   Add links from old pages and say that they are deprecated.

   As root install the main cyber-dojo 'shell' script
   $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonJagger/cyber-dojo/master/docker/cyber-dojo
   $ chmod +x it

   Type
   $ ./cyber-dojo
   If docker is not installed the script will list the installation commands
   taken from the Docker website. You can run these manually or, to get the
   cyber-dojo shell script to run them for you, type

   $ ./cyber-dojo install_docker

   Now you can bring up your cyber-dojo server.
   If this is a brand new cyber-dojo installation just type

   $ ./cyber-dojo up

   If there is already a cyber-dojo server on the host, type

   $ ./cyber-dojo up katas=PATH

   replacing PATH with the location of your katas folder. For example

   $ ./cyber-dojo up katas=/var/www/cyber-dojo/katas
