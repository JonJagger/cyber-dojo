# run as sudo

http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2013/10/tmpreaper-examples/
$ sudo apt-get install tmpreaper
Googling suggests to use full path for cron task

$ what tmpreaper
/usr/sbin/tmpreaper

$ cd ~
$ (sudo crontab -l ; echo "*/1 * * * * /usr/sbin/tmpreaper -f 30s /tmp") | sudo crontab -

This runs tmpreaper every minute (*/1) and deletes all files/folders
under /tmp that have not been accessed for 30 seconds or more.

It's worth considering running tmpreaper on the node instead
of doing

$ docker-machine ssh ${node} -- sudo rm -rf /tmp/${tmpFolder}

to remove the tmp folder
It will reduce network traffic and the load on the server.
It is also a bit of extra security in case anyone somehow manages
to rsync files to /tmp
