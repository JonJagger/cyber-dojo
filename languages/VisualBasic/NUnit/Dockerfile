# After much searching I came across this
#   https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=638337
# which hinted at the reason NUnit did not run when the
# Docker user was www-data, and not root. (see lib/DockerRunner.rb)
# The reason was that user www-data did not have HOME !!!
# and was probably defaulting to / which didn't have rights.

RUN usermod -m -d /home/www-data www-data
RUN mkdir /home/www-data
RUN chgrp www-data /home/www-data
RUN chown www-data /home/www-data
ENV HOME /home/www-data
